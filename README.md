# accessibility-refactoring

This code is a challenge to refactor existing code to enhance accessibility and to be more concise.

In this project, I was able to:
    1. Add alt text to the existing images in the code;
    2. Add a descriptive title to the webpage; 
    3. Add comments to the code for myself and future developers who may work on the code;
    4. Replace "<div>" elements with more appropriate semantic elements;
    5. Fix a broken link to the 'Search Engine Optimization' section;
